# ----------------------Variables: 
# Variables are containers for storing data values
#    Variables in Python are used to store data values. 
#    A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Variable names in Python can contain letters, numbers, and underscores but cannot start with a number. They are case-sensitive.


# ---------------------Functions: 
# Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. 
#   They provide modularity and help in code organization. 
#   In Python, you define a function using the def keyword followed by the function name, parameters (if any), and a colon. 
#   Functions can take inputs, perform operations, and optionally return a result using the return statement.



# ---------------------Lists:
# Lists are ordered collections of items in Python. 
#   They are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after creation. 
#   Lists are defined using square brackets [] and can contain elements of different data types, including other lists.



# ---------------------Dictionaries: 
# Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs in Python. 
#   They are mutable and are defined using curly braces {}. 
#   Each element in a dictionary consists of a key-value pair, where the key is unique and used to access its associated value. 
#   Dictionaries are commonly used for mapping relationships between items.



# --------------------Control Flow Statements: 
#   Control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program. 
#   They include conditional statements like if, elif, and else, which allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. 
#   Python also provides looping constructs like for and while, which allow you to iterate over sequences of data.



# --------------------Classes and Objects: 
#   Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP)
#   A class is a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of that class
#   Classes define attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on that data
#   Objects encapsulate data and behavior and promote code reuse and modularity.



# ----------------------Modules and Packages: 
#    Modules are Python files containing Python code, typically grouped together based on functionality. 
#    They allow you to organize your code into reusable components and provide namespaces to avoid naming conflicts. 
#    Packages are directories containing multiple modules and an __init__.py file, which indicates that the directory should be treated as a package.



# ------------------------Exceptions: 
# Exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of instructions. 
# When an exception occurs, it can be caught and handled using try and except blocks, allowing you to gracefully recover from errors. 
# Python provides built-in exception types for common error conditions, and you can also define custom exception classes to handle specific situations.
