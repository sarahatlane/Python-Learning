# ----------------------Variables: 
# Variables are containers for storing data values
#    Variables in Python are used to store data values. 
#    A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it. Variable names in Python can contain letters, numbers, and underscores but cannot start with a number. They are case-sensitive.


# ---------------------Functions: 
# Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. 
# They provide modularity and help in code organization. 
# In Python, you define a function using the def keyword followed by the function name, parameters (if any), and a colon. 
# Functions can take inputs, perform operations, and optionally return a result using the return statement.


# ---------------------Lists:
# Lists are ordered collections of items in Python. 
# They are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed after creation. 
# Lists are defined using square brackets [] and can contain elements of different data types, including other lists.
